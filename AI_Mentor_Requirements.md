# AI Mentor - Requirements Document

## 1. The Problem

### The Confusion-to-Execution Gap

Technology learners and developers face a critical bottleneck that prevents them from turning ideas into reality:

**The Learning Paralysis**
- Developers get stuck in tutorial hell, consuming endless content without building anything meaningful
- Learners know what they want to build but don't know where to start or what steps to take
- Information overload leads to analysis paralysis instead of productive action

**The Execution Barrier**
- Gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation
- Lack of contextual guidance when moving from concept to code
- No clear roadmap from "I want to build X" to "I have built X"

**The Guidance Void**
- Generic tutorials don't address specific project contexts or user constraints
- Stack Overflow answers solve isolated problems but don't provide holistic guidance
- Mentorship is expensive, limited, and not available when needed most

**The Accessibility Challenge**
- Language barriers prevent non-English speakers from accessing quality technical content
- Rural learners with limited connectivity cannot access online resources consistently
- Regional learners struggle with English-only technical documentation and tutorials

### Impact on Innovation

This gap results in:
- Abandoned projects and unfulfilled potential
- Slower technology adoption and skill development
- Reduced confidence in tackling complex technical challenges
- Wasted time cycling through resources without making progress
- Exclusion of talented learners due to language and connectivity barriers
